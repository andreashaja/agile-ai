# Backlog Refinement

**Purpose:** Capture ideas that emerge during sprints for future consideration.

This document collects feature requests, improvements, and ideas that come up during development but are **not part of the current sprint**. These items will be reviewed before each new sprint to decide if they should be added to the Product Backlog.

## How to Use This Document

When the user suggests a new feature during a sprint:
1. **Acknowledge** the idea positively
2. **Add it here** with context
3. **Continue** with the current sprint goal
