## Abstract

This paper presents Agile-AI, a framework that transfers established Agile project management principles to AI-assisted software development. The framework employs three specialized LLM agents (Visionary, Architect, and Sprinter) that guide users through structured phases of requirements engineering, technical planning, and iterative implementation.
